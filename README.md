# epfl_showcases
As I do the [Data Visualisation and Communication](https://www.extensionschool.ch/applied-data-science-communication-visualization) course by the [EPFL extension school](https://www.extensionschool.ch/), I would like to share what I learn. This is possible for the optional parts where I go and find data myself to plot in ways I learnt during the course.

# Running this yourself
This project uses `{renv}`, a virtual environment managing the dependencies. The dependencies can be installed with `renv::restore()`, and then all packages required for running the code are available. 

# What I plot

## 1. Timeseries  

## 2. Maps/cartograms
